# 🎙️ Speech-to-Text Transcription using Python

I built this simple script to convert `.wav` audio files into text using Python’s `speech_recognition` library and Google’s Web Speech API.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Transcribes English audio files (in `.wav` format) to text
- Tries both **American English (`en-US`)** and **British English (`en-GB`)** for better accuracy
- Handles unclear audio and API errors gracefully

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [`speech_recognition`](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)

Install the dependency using:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition

🚀 How to Use
	1.	Add your audio file (e.g., input.wav) to the project folder.
	2.	Make sure the filename in the script matches your file.
	3.	Run the script:

python transcribe.py

	4.	You’ll see the transcription result in your terminal, or an error message if the speech couldn’t be recognized.

🧠 How It Works

The script:
	•	Uses speech_recognition.AudioFile to read audio
	•	First tries recognition using en-US
	•	If that fails, it retries with en-GB
	•	Handles exceptions like:
	•	UnknownValueError – for unclear audio
	•	RequestError – for API access issues
